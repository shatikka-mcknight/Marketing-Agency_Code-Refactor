# Code-Refactor
Web development: accessibility. Mission:  Take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does)

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

Class requirements Homework Critera:

Added Semantic HTML elements
- Header
- Nav
- Section
- Aside
- Footer

Added Alt tags to all imagery
*I moved the class float-left & float right to the beginning of the element content*

Change .Class to #ID Variables
Combine content section into one class - content-catogories

Combine benefits section into one class - benefit-services

CSS Additional Updates
- add nav within the .header (div) to .header nav
- change .hero to .hero img
 - - remove background declaration
 - - set height to auto 
- Rearrange class and id in the order it appears within the HTML index.html file

I hade issue with github  'error: failed to push some refs to'
